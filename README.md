## Getlang - Language Detection from Audio Files

Welcome to Getlang! This is an open-source project aimed at helping you detect the language spoken in an audio file. Built using the power of the OpenAI's `whisper` model, Getlang provides a simple interface for audio language detection.

---

### How to use Getlang?

Running Getlang is as simple as running a script with a single command-line argument. You just need to provide the path to the audio file for which you want to detect the language.

For example, to detect the language in `your_audio_file.mp3`, you would run:

```bash
python getlang.py your_audio_file.mp3
```

Please replace `your_audio_file.mp3` with the actual path to your audio file.

The script will print the detected language to the console. For example, you might see:

```bash
The detected language is: English
```

### Requirements

This script requires Python and the `whisper` library, as well as a working Python environment. 

If you do not have `whisper` installed, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install whisper
```
